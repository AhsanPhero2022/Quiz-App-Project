            between those:</h3>
          <p class="py-4">
            (map), This method returns a new array containing the results of applying a given function to each element
            of the
            original array. The original array is not modified.
            <br><br>
            (filter), This method returns a new array containing all the elements of the original array that pass a
            given test
            function. The original array is not modified.
            <br><br>
            (forEach), This method executes a provided function once for each array element. It does not return a new
            array and does
            not modify the original array.
            <br><br>
            (find), This method returns the first element in the array that satisfies a given test function. It does not
            modify the
            original array.

          <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">All this uses mechanisms for storing data on the client-side in web
            applications. Here are the differences between them:</h3>
          <p class="py-4">(localStorage): This mechanism allows you to store data on the client-side that will persist
            even after the user closes
            their browser. The data is stored indefinitely until it is explicitly removed by the user or cleared by the
            application.
            The data is specific to a domain, meaning that other applications on the same domain cannot access it.
            <br><br>
            (sessionStorage): This mechanism allows you to store data on the client-side that will only last for the
            duration of the
            user's session. The data is cleared when the user closes their browser or when the session expires. The data
            is specific
            to a domain, meaning that other applications on the same domain cannot access it.
            <br><br>
            (cookies): This mechanism allows you to store data on the client-side that will persist even after the user
            closes their
            browser. Cookies are sent with every request to the domain that set them, meaning that they can be used to
            maintain
            state between requests. Cookies can be set with an expiration date, meaning that they can be used to store
            data for a
            specific period of time. Cookies are specific to a domain and can be accessed by other applications on the
            same domain.

          <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">What is an event loop and how does it work!</h3>
          <p class="py-4">event loop is a hard component of the JavaScript runtime environment. It's responsible for
            managing the execution of
            code and handling events in a non-blocking way.
            <br><br>
            The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous tasks and prevent the UI from
            becoming
            unresponsive. It continuously checks a queue of tasks and executes them one by one, allowing JavaScript to
            handle
            multiple tasks simultaneously without blocking the thread.
